# Ye-Jiada-Reach-The-Top
 I developed an obstacle jumping game named Reach the Top for children on Unity 3D. I applied 3D physical models to set many interesting and tricky obstacles to train their patience, outsight and flexibility. Using cute background music, characters and objects, I wanted to attract children to overcome difficulties, try repetitively to gain success and break the records of themselves through the game. A demo clip can be seen on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BspymCxVOvc.
